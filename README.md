## IIITA-ERP-Plus

Just adds some quality of life changes to IIITA's ERP site. Currently only displays attendance percentage.      
Contributions are welcome!


Right now the only way to install it is to do it as a userscript:
1. Install a userscript manager like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) 
2. Install the script from [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/507128-attendance-percentage-for-iiita-erp)
